#Heygen <> Lemón Email API integration

To automate the process of creating an avatar video through HeyGen’s API, retrieving the video link, and sending it via Lemón’s REST API, here’s a step-by-step outline:

1. Create Avatar Video via HeyGen’s API
Endpoint: Use HeyGen’s video generation API endpoint to create a customized video.

API Key: Ensure you have your HeyGen API key ready to authenticate requests.

Request Format: The request should include the avatar selection, voice preferences, and text for the avatar to speak.

Example Request:

bashCopy codecurl -X POST https://api.heygen.com/video/create \ -H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ \ -H ‘X-Auth-APIKey: YOUR_HEYGEN_API_KEY’ \ -d ‘{ “avatar”: “Avatar_Name”, “voice”: “Voice_Choice”, “text”: “Your video script here” }’

Response: HeyGen will respond with a video link upon successful creation.

2. Retrieve Video Link from HeyGen API Response
Store the link from HeyGen’s API response for embedding in the email. Ensure this link is accessible to the recipient by using any necessary permissions or settings for sharing.

3. Send the Video Link via Lemon’s REST API
Now, you can use Lemón’s transactional email API to email this video link.

Endpoint: https://app.xn--lemn-sqa.com/api/transactional/send

Headers: Include the Content-Type and X-Auth-APIKey.

Body: Construct the email content to include the video link in the HTML.

Example Request:

bashCopy codecurl -s -X POST https://app.xn--lemn-sqa.com/api/transactional/send \ -H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ \ -H ‘X-Auth-APIKey: YOUR_LEMON_API_KEY’ \ -d ‘{ “fromname”: “Sender Name”, “fromemail”: “sender@domain.com”, “to”: “recipient@domain.com”, “subject”: “Your Custom Video Message”, “body”: “<html><body>Watch your video <a href=\”https://heygen.com/videos/your_video_link\">here</a>.</body></html>" }’

By combining HeyGen’s and Lemon’s APIs, you can automatically generate personalized video messages and seamlessly distribute them via email.
