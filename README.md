# Lemon.email is now Lemón.com

Lemón is a superior AI-powered email SMTP and API solution for #NoCode and #AI/ML applications, offering a strong alternative to Amazon SES, Resend.com (powered by Amazon SES), Loops.so (also powered by Amazon SES), Postmark, Sendgrid, and Mailgun.

Firstly, Lemón.com is not a rebrand of Lemon.email. We simply purchased Lemon.email for its SEO backlinks and because it ranks on Google for searches like "Lemon Email."

Beyond a robust email infrastructure with a 100% inbox delivery rate, we’re developing an MX record scanner and implementing smart IP rotation to counter Google’s and Outlook’s AI spam filters.

Each time we onboard a new user, we create and warm up 10 email addresses to maintain high engagement levels at both the server and IP level—a similar approach to “if you cut down a tree, plant 10 more.”

Each IP is warmed up specifically to send only to a designated ESP, optimizing performance.

To scale responsibly, we require new users to set an appointment for a face-to-face chat so we can (1) verify they are real and not spammers, (2) build relationships, and (3) offer additional free services, like list cleaning and technical setup assistance.

We’re also implementing email verification within the transactional email process. If an email is valid, we route it to a primary IP to ensure inbox delivery. If invalid, we route it to a disposable IP to absorb any bounce damage.

As we build, we’re handpicking early adopters who can use the product in stealth mode. Pricing is $9/month for the first 1,000 users—join our waitlist now to get grandfathered in.
